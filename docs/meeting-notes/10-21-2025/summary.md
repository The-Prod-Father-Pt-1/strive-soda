Action Items

Notes
Video & Introductions
Gavin opened with greetings; Jack complimented the video, mentioning it was the best he had ever seen and noting its three and a half minute length instead of the expected 20 seconds.
Jack updated on his recent trip to Palm Beach and discussed his upcoming long drive to Naples, Fort Myers, and Tampa.
Hive Holiday Campaign
Plan to add a landing page for the "Hive for the Holidays" campaign featuring a vodka-based drink with cranberry lime and honey.
Theme "Make the Spirits Bright" will highlight cocktail recipes, holiday skits, and festive ad creative with a holiday CTA and copy changes.
Jack will perform multiple characters (e.g., a Jack Griswold Funk-style persona and a take on an I Love Lucy skit) to deliver comedic holiday content.
Design ideas include adding Christmas lights, red festive imagery, wrapping lights around the can, and using a video carousel with a social media feed (TikTok-like) feel.
Brainstormed using fake holiday reviews from characters such as the Grinch and Santa Claus for added humor.
The project deadline is tight with shooting on Tuesday/Wednesday and content ready by Friday/Saturday for a November 1 launch; Gavin confirmed he can meet the deadline despite other projects.
Website Design & Functionality
Homepage updates include shifting from sodium, potassium, and magnesium content to a soda-first approach transitioning into the hydration science page, with the 3D can update still pending.
Social media links have been tested in Shopify and can be updated if needed; mobile footer design may be simplified for responsiveness.
Issues noted on the product page such as the peach image being too short and a white space appearing on desktop when the video scrunches; Gavin mentioned these can be fixed quickly given the componentized structure.
Feedback was given on inconsistencies in font sizes, font weights, and button shapes (rounded vs. square) across pages, including the science and nutrition sections.
Discussion on using the "sciency" font (Poly Sans Mono) from Figma for the nutrition facts panel to tie in with the product can design, ensuring web font formats (SVG/WEBP) are used so that elements remain editable.
Emphasis on standardizing design elements across the site and improving hover effects (e.g., for nutritional bubbles) to enhance both aesthetics and SEO/AEO performance.
About Us Page & Navigation
Gavin proposed a checkerboard design for the About Us page using Tiffany blue with an unexpected yet welcome orange as a secondary color; both Jack and Chris responded positively.
Additional content such as updated images, team photos, and the Strive story (from Google Docs) was discussed to fill the page.
Discussion on consolidating empty spaces and possibly using a dropdown navigation (e.g., splitting between "Our Story" and "Store Locator") to avoid a half-finished look.
The store locator feature was identified as critical, both as a CTA on multiple pages and for long-term retail strategy, even as direct-to-consumer remains a priority now.
Compensation & Future Work
Talked about keeping Gavin on board for future projects, including the next phase of the Hive project and design updates for Strive; compensation and workload details will be discussed in upcoming calls.
Gavin mentioned that he will open up his schedule next week to fully focus on polishing these updates before the November 1 deadline.
Technical & Asset Details
Discussion on importing fonts from Figma using the Drive Soda toolkit from Dropbox; Chris sent Gavin the necessary font files, including the Poly Sans Mono for a scientific look.
The nutrition facts diagram on the product page was noted to be created in Figma, brought over in web-friendly formats (SVG/WEBP), and can be updated as needed.
Feedback was provided on standardizing button components (e.g., add to cart, shop buttons) and ensuring consistency in style across different parts of the site.
Gavin suggested using Motion AI as a notetaker in future meetings to capture key details and action points.
Closing Remarks
The team expressed enthusiasm about the creative and technical direction of the projects, with thanks exchanged and lighthearted banter about project continuity.
Plans to revisit detailed content updates and further design refinements in the next meeting were confirmed.
