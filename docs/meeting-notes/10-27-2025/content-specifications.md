## Brand Foundation

### Strive Soda - Boilerplate

Strive Soda is the first hydration soda — made for the movers, the shakers, and the tastemakers — delivering refreshing flavor and easy hydration.

Born in San Diego, Strive blends clean ingredients with electrolytes to keep you refreshed through life's endless adventure. It's not a performance drink or a sugar bomb. Strive proves you don't have to choose between great flavor and feeling great.

Inspired by our California playground; From the beaches to the boardroom.

### Strive - Mission

To craft drinks that keep you hydrated, fueled, and feeling alive — no compromises, ingredients that work as hard as you do.

Because when you're out there chasing your dream, you deserve a soda that shows up for you.

### Brand Mantra

**We Strive Together.**

## Content Hierarchy

### Strive Soda — Hierarchy of Information

#### 1. Soda First (Flavor Must Win)

**Core Idea:** It's a soda, not a supplement.

**Tone:** Confident, craveable, refreshing, repeatable.

**Messaging Goal:** Lead with enjoyment, not education.

**Design Implications:**
- Visuals should feel refreshing, bright, crave-inducing
- Think bubbles, chill, taste appeal — not lab coats or health halos

#### 2. Better-For-You (Hydration Through Electrolytes)

**Core Idea:** Strive is the only soda designed to hydrate you back.

**Tone:** Confident and casual — the benefit should sound effortless, not technical.

**Messaging Goal:** Own the white space — "the hydration soda."

This is your differentiator — the thing that gives Strive permission to exist in a world full of sugary sodas and wannabe "performance drinks."

**Design Implications:**
- Show hydration subtly — fluid motion, color gradients, light reflections
- Keep the focus on soda enjoyment

#### 3. Clean Ingredients (The Baseline, Not the Billboard)

**Core Idea:** Clean is the expectation, not the headline.

**Tone:** Confident and understated. Let people discover it, not be sold it.

**Messaging Goal:** Reinforce trust and transparency — but always after taste and hydration.

**Design Implications:**
- Ingredient cues should live in supporting visuals — ingredient photography, can copy, subtle callouts
- Don't dominate the story

## Founder Story

Strive Soda started with a simple question from founder, Jack Espy: Why can't soda taste great and feel great?

Jack, like many of us, grew up loving soda — the flavor, the fizz, the fun. With a lifestyle built around movement — the drinks he loved no longer fit the lifestyle. Most healthy sodas were laced with artificial sweeteners and hydration drinks were packed with too much sugar.

The first hydration soda was born. A drink that puts flavor first and adds a subtle boost of electrolytes for easy hydration through the day. Made with clean ingredients like organic honey, it's proof that soda can be both refreshing and better for you, without losing what makes it fun.
