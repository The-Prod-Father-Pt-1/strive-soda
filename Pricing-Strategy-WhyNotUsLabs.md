## HOW TO PRESENT TO CLIENTS

### The Conversation Script

**For New Clients:**

> "I offer two ways to work together.
>
> **Option 1** is traditional: I build your site for $X, then you pay hourly for any changes after launch at $350/hour.
>
> **Option 2** is what most of my clients prefer: I give you a significant discount on the build (bringing it down to $Y), and in exchange, you commit to a monthly retainer for the first 12 months. This gives you [X] hours per month for updates, new features, and priority support at a much lower rate of $150-175/hour.
>
> Here's why Option 2 usually makes more sense:
> - You save $[amount] upfront on the build
> - You get predictable monthly costs instead of surprise invoices
> - You get priority support and proactive monitoring
> - You have hours every month to improve and optimize
> - Most Shopify stores need 10-20 hours/month of work anyway (seasonal updates, new products, bug fixes, optimization)
>
> Think of it like having me on your team part-time, rather than calling a stranger every time something needs to change."

```markdown
## PRICING OPTIONS

## FINANCIAL MODELING

### Scenario: Strive Soda Build + Retainer

**Your Current Situation (Build-Only):**
- Revenue: $11,250 one-time
- Ongoing: $0/month (unless they request work)
- Year 1 Total: $11,250
- Year 2 Total: Unknown (maybe $0)

**With Retainer Model:**
- Initial Build: $7,875 (30% less)
- Retainer: $3,000/month × 12 = $36,000
- Year 1 Total: $43,875
- Year 2 Total: $36,000 (if they continue)
- **Difference: +$32,625 in Year 1 alone**

**Break-Even Analysis:**
- You "lost" $3,375 on the build discount
- You make it back in: 1.1 months of retainer
- Months 2-12: Pure profit increase

### Multiple Clients Model

**If you have 3 clients on Growth retainer:**
- 3 clients × $3,000/month = **$9,000/month recurring**
- Annual recurring revenue (ARR): **$108,000**
- Plus one-off builds: $15,000-30,000/year
- **Total potential: $120,000-140,000/year**

**With 5 clients:**
- 5 clients × $3,000/month = **$15,000/month recurring**
- ARR: **$180,000**
- Plus builds: $25,000-50,000/year
- **Total potential: $200,000-230,000/year**

This is how you build a **sustainable consulting business** instead of project-to-project hustle.

## BEST PRACTICES

### Do's ✅
- ✅ Always present retainer as "Option 2" not a requirement
- ✅ Show math clearly (they save upfront, get ongoing value)
- ✅ Track and report hours monthly
- ✅ Be proactive - find work before they ask
- ✅ Communicate regularly (weekly check-ins)
- ✅ Use rollover hours as incentive (they don't lose unused time)
- ✅ Set clear scope (what's included vs. additional projects)
- ✅ Offer annual pre-pay discount (10-15% off if they pay year upfront)

### Don'ts ❌
- ❌ Don't require retainer for all clients (some just want build)
- ❌ Don't let hours go to waste (suggest improvements)
- ❌ Don't overpromise hours (better to under-promise, over-deliver)
- ❌ Don't nickel-and-dime (small asks shouldn't eat retainer hours)
- ❌ Don't ignore unused hours (if they're not using them, find out why)
- ❌ Don't auto-renew without conversation (renegotiate at month 11)

### Red Flags 🚩
- Client consistently uses 0 hours/month (not a good fit)
- Client demands 24/7 support on lowest tier
- Scope creep without discussion
- Unpaid invoices
- Unrealistic expectations for included hours

## NEXT STEPS FOR STRIVE SODA

### Recommended Approach:

**For Current Project:**
Since you already completed build at $11,250, present as:

> "Hey [Client],
>
> Now that the initial build is live, I wanted to discuss ongoing support options. Most Shopify stores need regular updates—new products, seasonal changes, optimization, bug fixes, etc.
>
> I offer retainer packages starting at $1,500/month that include [X] hours of work + priority support. This works out to about $187/hour vs. my standard $350/hour for on-demand work.
>
> Want to hop on a call to discuss what makes sense for your needs?"

**For Future Clients:**
Present Build + Retainer option upfront:

- Build: $7,500-10,000 (discounted)
- Growth Retainer: $3,000/month × 12 months
- Total Year 1: $43,500-46,000
- Emphasize the $18,000+ savings vs. standard pricing

**Questions?**
This is your playbook for building predictable recurring revenue. Adjust pricing based on:
- Your market (higher in NYC/SF, lower in smaller markets)
- Client size (startups vs. established brands)
- Relationship (new vs. referral vs. existing)
- Scope (simple maintenance vs. complex development)

**The key:** Position retainer as a win-win, not a requirement.
